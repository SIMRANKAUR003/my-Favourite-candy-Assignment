                <h3>Facts</h3>
                <p>Gummy bears were invented in 1922
                    by German candy maker Hans Riegel.
                    He named the candy after his company, 
                    which was called Haribo.
                    
                    The original gummy bear flavors were 
                    raspberry, lemon, orange, strawberry, 
                    and pineapple.
                    Gummy bears are made from a mixture of
                    sugar, gelatin, flavorings, and colorings.
                    The gelatin used to make gummy bears 
                    comes from animal collagen, 
                    which is extracted from the bones 
                    and connective tissue of pigs and cows.
                    Gummy bears are a popular treat around 
                    the world, with variations and flavors 
                    unique to different countries.</p>
